parameter-estimation
====================

Stochastic process parameter estimation for non-linear dynamical systems.

The purpose of this project was to explore the methods by which one could estimate the values of parameters underlying a nonlinear dynamical system. To accomplish this, we examined the parameter Beta underlying a simulation of the Lorenz system in Matlab.
